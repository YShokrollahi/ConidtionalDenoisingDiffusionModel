# ConidtionalDenoisingDiffusionModel
This Python script uses TensorFlow and Keras to process and train a neural network model on a dataset of images and corresponding stress maps. The script includes functions for image preprocessing and dataset preparation. It then retrieves image files from specified directories, prepares the dataset, and splits it into training and validation sets.
