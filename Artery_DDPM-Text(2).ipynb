    "# Introduction\n",
    "What are diffusion models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoising diffusion models, including score-based generative models, have recently emerged as a strong group of generative models. They can even compete with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in terms of image synthesis quality. These models offer stability during training, scalability, and the ability to generate more varied samples. Large diffusion models like DALL-E 2 and Imagen have demonstrated impressive text-to-image generation abilities. However, a drawback is that they tend to be slower to sample from due to the multiple forward passes required for image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term 'diffusion' refers to the gradual conversion of a structured signal (such as an image) into noise. By simulating this process, we can produce noisy versions of our training images and train a neural network to denoise them. The trained network can then simulate the reversal of diffusion, also known as reverse diffusion, allowing an image to form from noise."

    "# Network architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we specify the architecture of the neural network that we will use for denoising. We build a U-Net with identical input and output dimensions. U-Net is a popular semantic segmentation architecture, whose main idea is that it progressively downsamples and then upsamples its input image, and adds skip connections between layers having the same resolution. These help with gradient flow and avoid introducing a representation bottleneck, unlike usual autoencoders. Based on this, one can view diffusion models as denoising autoencoders without a bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network takes two inputs, the noisy images and the variances of their noise components. The latter is required since denoising a signal requires different operations at different levels of noise. We transform the noise variances using sinusoidal embeddings, similarly to positional encodings used both in transformers and NeRF. This helps the network to be highly sensitive to the noise level, which is crucial for good performance. We implement sinusoidal embeddings using a Lambda layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We build the network using the Keras Functional API, and use closures to build blocks of layers in a consistent style.\n",
    "    Diffusion models embed the index of the timestep of the diffusion process instead of the noise variance, while score-based models (Table 1) usually use some function of the noise level. I prefer the latter so that we can change the sampling schedule at inference time, without retraining the network.\n",
    "    Diffusion models input the embedding to each convolution block separately. We only input it at the start of the network for simplicity, which in my experience barely decreases performance, because the skip and residual connections help the information propagate through the network properly.\n",
    "    In the literature it is common to use attention layers at lower resolutions for better global coherence. I omitted it for simplicity.\n",
    "    We disable the learnable center and scale parameters of the batch normalization layers, since the following convolution layers make them redundant.\n",
    "    We initialize the last convolution's kernel to all zeros as a good practice, making the network predict only zeros after initialization, which is the mean of its targets. This will improve behaviour at the start of training and make the mean squared error loss start at exactly 1.\n"
